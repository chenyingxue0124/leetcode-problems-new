###   Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

###   A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
###   Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
###   and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
###   or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
###   Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

###   Example: 19 is a happy number

###   12 + 92 = 82 #2 is square
###   82 + 22 = 68
###   62 + 82 = 100
###   12 + 02 + 02 = 1
###   hash table / math

def isHappy(n):
    mem = set() #prevent same digits
    while n != 1:
        n = sum([int(i) ** 2 for i in str(n)]) #calculate the sum of the squres of its digits
        if n in mem: # means it loops endlessly in a cycle
            return False
        else:
            mem.add(n) #add new n
    else:
        return True
