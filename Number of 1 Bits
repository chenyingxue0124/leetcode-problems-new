### Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
### For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

def hammingWeight(n):
    """
    :type n: int
    :rtype: int
    """
    mean = "{0:032b}".format(n) #先转换成32位的表现形式
    return(mean.count("1"))

print(hammingWeight(11))
